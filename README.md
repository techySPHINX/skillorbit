# SkillOrbit

## 📝 Problem Statement

Many people have valuable skills they want to share but lack access to formal courses or money to learn new skills. **SkillOrbit** solves this by creating a platform where users can **exchange skills directly with each other** in a barter-style system – for example, teaching Photoshop in exchange for Excel lessons. This promotes peer-to-peer learning, accessibility, and community growth without financial barriers.
